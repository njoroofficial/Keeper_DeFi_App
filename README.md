# dkeeperApp

This is a simple project that demonstrates how to use the DFINITY SDK to create a decentralized application (dapp) on the Internet Computer. The project is built using Motoko and JavaScript, and it includes a simple frontend that interacts with the backend canisters.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 14 or later)
- [DFX](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developers-guide/install-upgrade-remove/) (version 0.10.0 or later)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (for cloning the repository)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or any other code editor of your choice)
- [Motoko](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/motoko-intro/) (for writing smart contracts)
- [Candid](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/candid/candid-intro/) (for defining the interface of your smart contracts)
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) (for end-to-end testing)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (for building the frontend)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) (for bundling the frontend code)


If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd dkeeperApp/
dfx help
dfx config --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
